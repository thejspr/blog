      For the past 7 years I have worked as a developer in several startups,
      working with various technologies like Ruby on Rails, React and Android.
      Throughout this time I have evolved my skills in building features that
      focus on solving the problem in the simplest and fastest way possible. I
      believe that getting a feature out in front of the user and iterating on
      it based on their feedback and behaviour, is the most important aspect of
      whether it will be a success.

      I love being involved in the creative process from idea conception to
      deploying and maintaining the finished product, and this is one of the
      reasons I decided to become a self-employed software consultant in
      2015. I am well-versed in both front-end and back-end development, not
      shying away from anything that is needed to get the job done. Whilst I
      enjoy working with the latest and greatest frameworks and languages, I
      prefer using stable technologies that have been tested and honed.

      In summery, the values that drive my work are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Communication is paramount to the success of a project.</li>
      <li>A problem is best solved in iterations guided by a solid feedback loop.</li>
      <li>Test-Driven Development helps ensure the correctness and maintainability of a system.</li>
    </ul>
