<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="/img/me.png" alt="Jesper Kjeldgaard" class="profile-image">

<p>
  For the past 10 years, I have worked with full-stack development in
  several startups and companies, mostly revolving around Ruby on Rails.
  Latest as a senior software engineer at Peanut, building APIs for scaling
  a social network for women. Before that as CTO and co-founder building a
  platform for ordering and delivering graphic designs.
</p>

<p>
  My drive comes from delivering value to the business, and I love being
  part of solving problems from initial ideas to deployment. Besides having
  solid experience in building web-applications, I also have experience with
  marketing automation, finance, analytics, mobile development and leading
  small teams.
