    <p>
      For the past 3 years I have worked as a developer in two startups, both
      revolving around Ruby on Rails applications. Throughout this time I have
      evolved my skills in building features that focus on solving the problem in
      the simplest and fastest way possible. I believe that getting a feature out
      in front of the user and iterating on it based on their feedback and
      behaviour, is the most important aspect of whether it will be a success.

      I love being involved in the creative process from idea conception to deploying
      and maintaining the finished product, and this is one of the reasons I have
      decided to become self-employed as a freelancer in 2015. I am well-versed in
      both front-end and back-end development, not shying away from anything that
      needs doing to get the job done.
