      For the past 3 years I have worked as a developer in two startups, both
      revolving around Ruby on Rails applications. Throughout this time I have
      evolved my skills in building features that focus on solving the problem in
      the simplest and fastest way possible. I believe that getting a feature out
      in front of the user and iterating on it based on their feedback and
      behaviour, is the most important aspect of whether it will be a success.

      I love being involved in the creative process from idea conception to
      deploying and maintaining the finished product, and this is one of the
      reasons I have decided to become self-employed as a freelancer in 2015. I
      am well-versed in both front-end and back-end development, not shying
      away from anything that needs doing to get the job done. Whilst I enjoy
      working with the latest and greatest frameworks and languages, I prefer
      using stable technologies with sizeable communities and usage.

      In summery, the values that drive my work are;
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A problem is best solved in iterations guided by a solid feedback loop.</li>
      <li>TDD helps ensure the correctness and maintainability of a system.</li>
      <li>Communication is paramount to the success of a project.</li>
    </ul>
