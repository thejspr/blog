I started Android development last year, and have since then made gained some
experience in how to write better Android apps, faster. See [the first
post](/blog/faster-android-development/)
in this series if you haven't already.

## Android Studio shortcuts

Android studio is a powerhouse of productivity onve you get used to it and learn
all the shortcuts.
[This guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/15.0/discover-intellij-idea.html)
covers a lot of the most important shortcuts. Below are the ones I use most:

- **⇧⌘F12** : Close all tool windows to allow more focus on the editor.

- **⇧⇧** : Search everywhere

- **⌘o** : Search classes (faster than the above if you need to find a class)

- **⌘e** : Open recently openedfiles

- **⌘1** : Toggle file drawer

- **⌘b** : Go to class/method definition

- **⌃r** : Run (using last configuration)

## Let the IDE manage imports

Change you IDE setting to let Android Studio take care of adding, removing and
organizing imports.

This way you dont have to deal with missing and unused imports.
