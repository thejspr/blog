In my never ending quest to learn more about the world and becoming the best
person I can be, I've accumulated some techniques to optimise for as much
learning as possible in my daily life.

## Audiobooks

Audiobooks are a great way to devour books whilst on the move. Whether it's
fiction or non-fiction, audiobooks can help turn the daily commute to and from
work. I use [Audible](http://www.audible.co.uk) for this purpose, it has a vast
library and even the possibility to speed up playback. I rarely speed up
fiction, but non-fiction I usually play at 1.25-1.5x speed. Some of my favourite
audiobooks include:

* David Foster Wallace - This is Water
* The Happiness Hypothesis
* Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

## Podcasts

Similar to audiobooks, podcasts are a great way to accumulate knowledge on
topics you're interested in. One benefit over audiobooks is that they are a bit
more bite-sized and can usually be completed in one setting. My favourite
podcasts are interviews with interesting people, some of those are:

* Stuff you should know
* Giant Robots
* NPR - All Songs Considered

## Conclusion

Whilst learning by filling in the gaps with audiobooks and podcasts is useful,
it is likewise beneficial to switch off and be present and mindful. If you have
other methods of accelerated learning I'd love to hear about it so please leave
a comment or get in touch.
