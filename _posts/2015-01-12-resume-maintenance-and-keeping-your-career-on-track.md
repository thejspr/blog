title: Treat your resume as code

Although debatable whether the resume still has a place amongst LinkedIn and
Github profiles, I like to keep mine up to date and at hand to attach to
introductions and job applications.

Every time I've changed jobs, or considered doing so, I've encountered the pain
of having to make changes to my outdated resume. Whilst thinking about how to keep my
resume up to date I came up with the metaphor of treating my resume as code and
this post lists the benefits of doing so.

## Monthly resume review

I've schedule a monthly recurring event in my calendar to review my resume and
keep it up to date on where I am at in my career. This enables me to add newly
acquired skills and projects I've worked on whilst the experieneces are still
fresh in my mind.


## Maintenance

Its easier to keep an application running smoothly up to date by continously
spending time refactoring and updating dependencies. The same follows for
keeping a resume up to date. Why not spend 30 minutes every month and always
have an up to date version, than having to scramble and spend hours when you
eventually need to send your resume to a potential employer.

## Keeping your career on track

Another benefit of routinely reading and editing your resume is that you get to
check whether your profile is moving towards where you want to be. You might
also discover that your career is stagnant if you don't have anything useful to
add over a period of time, a sign that you are not learning and growing in your
current role.


## Conclusion

Reviewing my resume every month for the last year has worked out great for me
and I emplore you to try it out for yourself.
