title: Ruby e-commerce frameworks: spree vs solidus
---

Being in the process of building a web-application with e-commerce elements, I
started looking for a framework to do the heavy lifting managing products,
transactions and stock. For Ruby on Rails, there are [several e-commerce
rubygems](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/e_commerce) available, the
biggest being Spree, Shoppe and Solidus. Shoppe seems dead, so I'm discarding
that option off the bat. It's now down to Spree and the Spree-fork, Solidus.
What follows is my biased opinion of which is better for my use-case.

Solidus was [forked from Spree](http://solidus.io/blog/2015/10/28/future-of-spree.html)
in 2015 when the company behind Spree was acquired.
