I've recently been getting into React, and this post is a list of the
resources I found useful and insightful whilst learning this new technology.


### [Pete Hunt: React: Rethinking best practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY)

Pete Hunt describes how React is designed and the thoughts and ideas behind how
it works, and the problems it solves compared to other libraries. A good place
to start. From JSConf EU 2013, but still relevant.

### [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

Step-by-step buide to building a simple component in React. Written by Pete Hunt
as well.


### [React documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html)

The official React documentation is a great up-to-date resource for learning the
ins and outs of the library.


### [ES6 guide](https://mrzepinski.gitbooks.io/es6-guide/content/index.html)

A great free guide for ES6 describing all the exciting new features coming to
JavaScript. You can safely use it today with a transpiler like BabelJS or the
like.


## That's it!

For now... I will post more resources as I go deeper down the rabbit hole.
