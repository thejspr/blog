For the past 3 years I have worked in two London-based startups, building Saas
and E-commerce Rails applications. This period gave me a lot of experience
building software for the web and I had the pleasure of working in two great
teams, fostering many connections and friendships.

Whilst I have enjoyed working as an employee, I have always yearned for
entrepreneurship and working for myself. This led me to start freelancing on
nights and weekends in August 2013 to gauge whether this way of working was for
me. Over the next year I worked with several clients, learning a lot about
entrepreneurship and more importantly confirming that I'd like to go work for
myself full-time.

Having made the decision I started saving up money that would give me a run-way
to get my company up and running, without having to worry about not being able
to pay rent. I also had to make the hard decision to move back to Denmark after
living in London for over 4 years. It was tough having to leave my friends and
everything London has to offer, but I was also excited to go home and spend more
time with family and friends.

The move happened in December 2014 and I was able to work remotely for
HouseTrip that month whilst I got settled back into living in Denmark. January
5th I went full-time, and at the time of writing my first week as
a self-employed software consultant is coming to a close.

I'm really loving working for myself so far, the amount of freedom and
opportunity is humbling albeit slightly daunting. The chase is on to find my
first clients, and I'm knee deep in marketing jargon and lead generation. If you
are in need of my services, web and mobile development, or know someone
that is, I'd love to [hear from you](mailto:thejspr@gmail.com).

Thank you for reading and happy new year!
