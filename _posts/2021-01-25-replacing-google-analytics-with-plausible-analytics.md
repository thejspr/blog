title: Replacing Google Analytics with Plausible Analytics
---

Online privacy is a hot topic these days, and I've been thinking about my stance
and what actions I can take to make it better. For starters I've started using
DuckDuckGo as my main search engine. I love the !-bang searches, and the results
are generally good.

Another action I'm taking is replacing Google Analytics across my sites with
[Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/). It's really good and doesn't do
all the evil tracking google does, more reasonse
[here](https://plausible.io/vs-google-analytics).
