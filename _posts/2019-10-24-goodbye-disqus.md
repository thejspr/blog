Privacy concerns on the internet are everywhere these days, and it made me
wonder what my own actions in this aspect are. It got me thinking about the

rendering a lot of third-party javascript and tracking I have no control over. I
couldn't really come up with any good reasons so I'm removing Diqus from all
pages.
