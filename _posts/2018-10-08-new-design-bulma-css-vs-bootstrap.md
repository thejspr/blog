title: "New design: Bulma.css vs. Bootstrap"
---

I've wanted to redesign the blog slightly for a while and thought I'd couple
this rewrite with learning a new css framework called
[Bulma.css](https://bulma.io).

## The good

* It' was quite easy to get going, and I like some of the nice header styles that comes with the framework.
* It's also an easy transition from Bootstrap as it follows a similar philosophy.

## The bad

* No utility classes for simple padding and margin tweaks.
* No JavaScript components for common features like modals, navbars etc.
* The require heirachy of `.container`, `.content` and `section` is a bit
    unintuitive to me.

## Conclusion

I'm not entirely sold on the framework yet, though it has been a pleasent
experience working with it for a few hours.

I'm still iterating on the design, but thought it better to ship it as is than
leave it to rot in a git branch. You can see the old design [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180901062031/https://thejspr.com).
